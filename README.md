# MOS-tpot
A small malware organization script to organize files captured in the tpot honeypot

This basically will go through downloaded/captured files from a tpot cowrie instance and move those files into a well organized structure.
This allows for quicker and better analysis of the files as they are received. 

In tpot's current cowrie configuration, organization is a trivial task that takes a lot of time. 

This should aid in faster analysis of those files.
